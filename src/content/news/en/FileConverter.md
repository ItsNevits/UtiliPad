# File Converter

Easily convert between document and spreadsheet formats directly in your browser. Supported formats include DOCX, XLSX, XLS, ODS, CSV, and JSON. You can convert files individually or in bulk, and download all results as a ZIP file.

## Features

- Convert DOCX to HTML or TXT
- Convert XLSX, XLS, ODS to CSV, JSON, or HTML
- Convert CSV and JSON to XLSX or each other
- Batch conversion and ZIP download
- Drag & drop or file selection
- Multilingual support

## How to use

1. Drag and drop your files or click to select them.
2. Choose the desired output format for each file.
3. Download each file or all as a ZIP.

## Notes

- Nested data (like arrays/objects in JSON) is preserved when converting between JSON and CSV/XLSX.
- Some formatting may be lost when converting between very different formats.
- Some file types are not supported by free libraries, so they are not available for conversion.
