# Enhanced File Converter

We've significantly expanded our File Converter! It now supports a much wider variety of document, spreadsheet, and data formats. Easily convert between multiple formats directly in your browser, no installation required.

## Newly Supported Conversions

### Documents
- **DOCX** → HTML, TXT, PDF
- **TXT** → DOCX
- **MD (Markdown)** → DOCX, HTML
- **HTML** → PDF

### Spreadsheets
- **XLSX, XLS, ODS** → CSV, JSON, HTML

### Data Formats
- **CSV** → XLSX, JSON
- **JSON** → XLSX, CSV

## Features

- Convert between more than 10 different formats
- Visual interface organized by categories (Documents, Spreadsheets, Data Formats)
- Batch conversion and ZIP download
- Drag & drop or file selection
- Global selector to apply the same format to all compatible files
- Multilingual support
- 100% browser-based processing (your files never leave your device)

## How to use

1. Drag and drop your files or click to select them.
2. Choose the desired output format for each file.
3. Optionally, use the "All" selector to apply the same format to compatible files.
4. Download each file individually or all together as a ZIP.

## Notes

- Nested data (like arrays/objects in JSON) is preserved when converting between JSON and CSV/XLSX.
- Some formatting may be lost when converting between very different formats.
- PDF conversions maintain the visual format of the original document.
- Support for MD (Markdown) files makes it easy to convert technical documentation.
