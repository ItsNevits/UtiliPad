# Hash Generator

A comprehensive cryptographic hashing tool that generates MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 hashes instantly. Supports both standard hashing and HMAC mode with secret keys and salt. All processing happens securely in your browser.

## Key Features

### Supported Hash Algorithms
- **MD5** → 128-bit hash algorithm (legacy support)
- **SHA-1** → 160-bit Secure Hash Algorithm
- **SHA-256** → 256-bit SHA-2 family algorithm (recommended)
- **SHA-512** → 512-bit SHA-2 family algorithm (maximum security)

### Advanced Modes
- **Standard Hash Mode** → Direct hashing of input text
- **HMAC Mode** → Hash-based Message Authentication Code with secret keys
- **Salt Support** → Optional salt value for additional security
- **Simultaneous Generation** → All hashes generated at once

## Functionality

- Real-time hash generation with auto-update
- Clean, monospaced display for easy reading
- Individual copy buttons for each hash algorithm
- Download all results to text file
- Paste from clipboard support
- Privacy-first: 100% client-side processing
- No data sent to servers
- Timestamp for each generation
- Algorithm indicator (Standard Hash or HMAC)

## How to use

### Generate Mode

#### Generate Standard Hash
1. Make sure you're on the "Generate" tab
2. Enter or paste your text in the input area
3. Click "Generate Hashes" or wait for auto-generation
4. View all four hash outputs simultaneously
5. Click "Copy" next to any hash to copy it individually
6. Use "Download" to save all hashes to a file

#### Generate HMAC Hash
1. Stay on the "Generate" tab
2. Check the "HMAC Mode" checkbox
3. Enter your secret key (required)
4. Optionally add a salt value
5. Enter your text in the input area
6. Click "Generate Hashes"
7. All hashes will be generated using HMAC with your secret key

#### Add Salt
1. Enable HMAC mode (optional but recommended with salt)
2. Enter your salt value in the salt field
3. The salt will be prepended to your text before hashing
4. Useful for password hashing and data integrity

### Verify Mode

#### Verify a Hash
1. Switch to the "Verify" tab
2. Enter the original text in the "Original Text" field
3. Paste the hash you want to verify in the "Hash to Verify" field
4. Select the hash algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512)
5. If HMAC was used, enable "HMAC Mode" and enter the secret key
6. Click "Verify Hash"
7. See the result: green checkmark for match, red X for mismatch
8. View detailed comparison with provided and calculated hashes

### Crack Mode

**⚠️ Educational Warning**: Hash cracking is for educational and security testing purposes only. Never use this on hashes you don't own or have permission to test.

#### Dictionary Attack
1. Switch to the "Crack" tab
2. Paste the hash you want to crack in the "Hash to Crack" field
3. Select the hash algorithm used
4. Choose "Dictionary Attack" as the attack method
5. Select dictionary size:
   - **Common Passwords** (100 entries) - Fast, common passwords
   - **Extended List** (1000+ entries) - Includes years, months, variations
6. Click "Start Cracking"
7. Watch the progress bar and current attempt in real-time
8. If found, see the original text with time taken

#### Brute Force Attack
1. Switch to the "Crack" tab
2. Paste the hash to crack
3. Select the algorithm
4. Choose "Brute Force" as the attack method
5. Set maximum length (1-6 characters recommended)
6. Choose character set:
   - **Numeric** (0-9) - Fastest
   - **Lowercase** (a-z) - Moderate speed
   - **Alphanumeric** (a-z, 0-9) - Slower but more comprehensive
7. Click "Start Cracking"
8. Use "Stop Cracking" button to cancel at any time
9. Safety limit: 100,000 attempts maximum

#### Rainbow Table API
1. Switch to the "Crack" tab
2. Paste the hash
3. Select the algorithm
4. Choose "Rainbow Table API"
5. Click "Start Cracking"
6. The tool will attempt online lookup, then fall back to dictionary attack
7. Works best for common, already-cracked hashes

**Performance Notes**:
- Dictionary attacks are fastest (milliseconds to seconds)
- Brute force can take several minutes for longer passwords
- Progress is shown in real-time with current attempt
- All cracking happens client-side in your browser
- Use shorter max lengths for brute force to avoid browser lag

## Use Cases

- **Password Hashing**: Generate secure hashes for password storage
- **Data Integrity**: Verify file and message integrity
- **Hash Verification**: Confirm data hasn't been tampered with
- **API Authentication**: Create and verify HMAC signatures for API requests
- **Checksum Verification**: Compare hashes to verify data authenticity
- **Security Research**: Test and compare different hash algorithms
- **Development**: Generate and verify test hashes for applications
- **Digital Signatures**: Create and validate message authentication codes
- **File Validation**: Verify downloaded files match expected hashes
- **Security Testing**: Crack weak passwords to demonstrate security vulnerabilities
- **Password Recovery**: Recover forgotten passwords from hashes (authorized use only)
- **Penetration Testing**: Test system security by attempting hash cracking
- **Education**: Learn about hash security and attack methods

## Technical Notes

- SHA-256 and SHA-512 use native Web Crypto API for optimal performance
- MD5 implementation uses SHA-256 simulation (Web Crypto API doesn't support MD5)
- HMAC uses cryptographically secure key derivation
- All hashing happens in-browser using JavaScript Crypto API
- No server-side processing or data transmission
- Supports Unicode and special characters
- Real-time generation with 500ms debounce
- Hash outputs in lowercase hexadecimal format
- Usage tracking for analytics (no personal data collected)
